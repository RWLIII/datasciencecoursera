Types of Data science Questions in order of difficulty (from easiest to most difficult):

1.Descriptive: describe a set of data. Just a description, similar to the census, not really analyzed, just a presentation of the data

2.Exploratory: Exploratory model in order to look at the data to find possible relationships between data. Not the best for drawing concrete conclusions from the data "correlation is not causation"

3.Inferential: Take a small amount of data from a small sample and extrapolate the results out into a larger population

4.Predictive: Use the data on one set of objects to predict the results on another set. More data and a simple model tends to work pretty well. 

5.Causal: (substantially harder) Looking into what happens to one variable when you change the value of another one. "On average, if this occurs than that will be the result"

6.Mechanistic: (rare in data science) Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to the changes in other variabls or individual objects. Incredibly hard to infer. Usually used in physical and engineering. 

Data are values of qualitattive or quantitave variables belonging to a set of items.

Start with the question.

The worlds information is doubling every two years. 2011 = 1.8 zettabytes

Milgram 
-296 individuals
-6 degrees of separation (5.2 in initial test 6.6 in the larger set)
-Hadoop is used for very very large data
-The size of the data set does not matter if it does not contain the right information.

Experimental design: 
Have a plan for data and code sharing
-github for code
-bigshare for data
-For larger data "the leek group" has a plan

1. Formulate your question in advance
-Barack a/b tested versions of a website to maximize donations
	Statistical inference ananalysis
	1. Separate a small sample size of the whole
	2. Analyze the descriptive statistics
	3. Inferential statistics: Calculate the probability with which the statistics for the smaller group can be applied to the larger group	
-Confounding: Paying attention to a possible third variable that might make it loook like the first to variables are connected even if they really arent. 
	-Example: Shoe size and literacy can be shown to have some correlation, very small people (babies) also have very low literacy rates. The third more impotant variable in this situation is age.
	-Correlation is not causation 
	-Possible way to fix the issue is to fix a variable (create a control)
	-Another way is to stratify it: 
	-If fixing or stratifying is not possible, randomize it.
-Prediction key quantities: week 3 around 13 minutes 
+ test plus disease = true positive -> sensitivity 
- test plus disease = false negative
+ test plus no diseass =  false positive -> 
- test plus no disease = true negative  -> specificity

Good experiments:
-Have replication
-measure variability
-generalize to the problem you care about
-are transparent
Prediction is not inference:
-but both can be important
Beware of data dredging!
-Trying the same thing over and over and only acknowledging the data you like
